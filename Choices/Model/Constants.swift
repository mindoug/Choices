// A constants file can store frequently used constants globally so they can be used throughout the code
// In this case, it helps clean up our code by removing large chunks of text, making it easier to read

// we use the static keyword in the constants below so we can refer to them in our code without having to create an instance of the struct on the view controller in order to use them
